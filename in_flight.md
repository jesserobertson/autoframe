# API Simplification - Remaining Tasks

## Current Status
The major API simplification has been completed across 4 comprehensive phases, with significant progress made on test compatibility. The codebase has been reduced by ~1000+ lines while maintaining functionality.

## Completed Phases
✅ **Phase 1:** Removed over-engineered abstractions (abstract classes, adapter patterns, redundant wrappers)
✅ **Phase 2:** Consolidated MongoDB functionality and eliminated configuration system  
✅ **Phase 3:** Streamlined quality logging and modernized error handling with pattern matching
✅ **Phase 4:** Updated imports and began fixing test compatibility

## Completed Tasks ✅

### ✅ Fix test imports and remove obsolete tests
**Status:** 100% complete

**What was done:**
- Fixed `tests/integration/test_mongodb_integration.py` imports ✅
- Fixed `tests/unit/test_mongodb_mocked.py` imports and updated all mock patches ✅
- Removed obsolete `tests/unit/test_config_simple.py` (config system was removed) ✅
- Removed obsolete `tests/unit/test_logging_simple.py` (logging is now transparent) ✅
- Updated all test files that imported from deleted modules ✅

### ✅ Fix frames/core.py QueryBuilder references  
**Status:** 100% complete

**What was done:**
- Simplified `frames/core.py` by removing QueryBuilder pattern ✅
- Updated `create_dataframe()` function to work with document lists only ✅
- Updated `tests/unit/test_basic.py` to remove imports from deleted modules ✅
- Fixed pattern matching syntax for modern logerr version ✅

### ✅ Pattern matching compatibility fixes
**Status:** 100% complete

**What was done:**
- Fixed all `case Ok(_):` and `case Err(_):` patterns to use `case Ok():` and `case Err():` ✅
- Updated destructuring patterns to use `case Ok() as ok:` and `case Err() as err:` ✅
- Fixed issues in `autoframe/quality.py` and `autoframe/utils/retry.py` ✅

### ✅ Run test-all to ensure everything works
**Status:** 100% complete - ALL TESTS PASSING ✅

**Final results:**
- **82 tests passed, 0 failed** ✅
- All integration tests working ✅
- All unit tests working ✅  
- All doctests working ✅
- Test coverage: 69.15% ✅

## Key Changes Made

### API Exports Simplified
**Before:** 15+ exports including manual logging functions, config system, redundant wrappers
**After:** 11 essential exports focusing on core functionality

```python
# Current simplified exports
__all__ = [
    "mongodb", "create_pipeline", "to_dataframe", "apply_schema", "pipe",
    "with_database_retry", "with_network_retry", "retry_with_backoff",
    "log_result_failure", "log_conversion_operation", "__version__"
]
```

### Module Structure Simplified
**Before:**
```
autoframe/
├── config.py (285 lines) 
├── sources/
│   ├── base.py (abstract classes)
│   ├── mongodb.py (adapter pattern)
│   └── simple.py (242 lines)
├── quality.py (400+ lines manual logging)
```

**After:**
```
autoframe/
├── mongodb.py (consolidated - all MongoDB functionality)
├── sources/ (empty - ready for future data sources)
├── quality.py (90 lines - transparent logging only)
```

### Error Handling Modernized
**Before:** `if result.is_ok(): ...` patterns
**After:** `match result: case Ok(data): ... case Err(error): ...` patterns

### Logging Philosophy Changed
**Before:** Manual logging calls throughout code
**After:** Transparent automatic logging through Result framework

## Testing Strategy
Once remaining fixes are complete:
1. Run `pixi run test-all` to identify any remaining issues
2. Fix import errors and update test assertions as needed  
3. Remove obsolete tests (config system tests)
4. Ensure integration tests work with consolidated MongoDB module

## Architecture Benefits Achieved
- **Simplified API** - removed redundant functions and over-engineered abstractions
- **Transparent error handling** - automatic logging through Result types
- **Modern Python patterns** - pattern matching instead of imperative checks  
- **Explicit parameters** - no complex configuration system
- **Consolidated functionality** - single source of truth for MongoDB operations
- **Functional composition** - preserved pipeline-style chaining while removing complexity
