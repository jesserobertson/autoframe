## Getting Started Right Now

The most important first steps to get the project off the ground:

1. **Set up the development environment**: Create pixi.toml and pyproject.toml
2. **Create the basic structure**: Package directories and __init__.py files
3. **Write your first test**: Even a simple smoke test to verify imports work
4. **Implement a minimal MongoDB connection**: Just connecting and querying one document
5. **Create a simple dataframe**: Convert that one document to a pandas DataFrame

From there, you can iterate and build up the functionality incrementally while maintaining a working system at each step.
