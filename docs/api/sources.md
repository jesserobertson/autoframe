# Data Sources API

This section documents the data source functionality. 

As part of the API simplification, all MongoDB functionality has been consolidated into `autoframe.mongodb`. The sources module is kept for future data source extensions but currently contains no active functionality.

For MongoDB operations, see the main API documentation.
